    <div class="panel">
        <p>A cognitive illusion is usually a picture that is meant to show an ambiguous image or images. These images can be
            meant to confuse the senses or to require the mind to refocus attention to see both images. These kinds of illusions
            are categorized as ambiguous, distorting, or paradox illusions. Ambiguous images are figures that force the brain to 
            switch back and forth between two separate images.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does it work?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Instead of demonstrating a physiological base they interact with different levels of perceptual processing, 
           in-built assumptions or ‘knowledge’ are misdirected. Cognitive illusions are commonly divided into ambiguous illusions, 
            distorting illusions, paradox illusions, or fiction illusions. They often exploit the predictive hypotheses of early 
            visual processing. Stereograms are based on a cognitive visual illusion</p>

        <p>When you are able to perceive the same image differently due to a distortion of its size, curve,
            length, or position, it is known as a distorting illusion. These illusions occur when the physical
            aspect of the image is modified, making you change your perception entirely. The illusion however, is
            not caused by a change in the dimensions of the image. Rather, the fact that you can see a change is
            the illusion itself, as the image remains constant but you perceive its dimensions to be ever changing 
            rather than remaining constant.</p>

        <p>Fictional illusions are those that are not actually created but are perceived by one individual. These illusions are also called hallucinations and can be induced due
            to schizophrenia or a hallucinogen. In these illusions, the observer sees images that are not even present in front of him or her, and these images are seen by the
            observe alone, without the presence of an actual stimulus.</p>
